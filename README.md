# FinalProjectMFRT
This is my final project for the Microsoft Future-Ready Talent Internship. I have created a car-rental website that acts as a platform for renting cars for traveling from one place to another. On this website, I have created six pages: HOME, ABOUT, CARS, BLOG, CONTACT US, and LOGIN. While creating this website, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I deployed this website using static web apps, created a bot using Azure Bot Services, and deployed the same on Telegram.

While we have other platforms such as Uber and Ola. However, Rent4U rents a car to its users, which they can drive themselves.

I created this project using Microsoft Azure Services. First, I created the website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Then, I created a GitHub repository for the website. Later on, I deployed the website using Azure Static Web. Azure Static Web Apps is a service that automatically builds and deploys full-stack web apps to Azure from a code repository. The reason behind using Azure Static Web Apps was that when a user creates an Azure Static Web Apps resource, Azure interacts directly with GitHub or Azure DevOps to monitor a branch of your choice, and every time the user pushes commits or accepts pull requests into the watched branch, a build automatically runs and the app and API deploy to Azure.

When the website was deployed, I created a chatbot using Azure Cognitive Services. First, I went to Azure Language Services and created a language service for custom question answering. When that was created, I went to Language Studio. There I created a custom question-answering model, which is the next generation of QnA Maker used to answer FAQs or a set of questions. Edit the knowledge base using the URL of the website and deploy the chatbot again using Azure. After deployment, I deployed that chatbot on Telegram using the channel.

Please note that as my student subscription limit exceeded, I deleted all resources. I am attaching some example images for reference to the services I used.
