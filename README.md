# FinalProjectMFRT
This is my final project for Microsoft Future Ready Talent Internship. I have created a car-rental website that acts as a platform for renting cars for traveling from one place to another. On this website, I have created six pages: HOME, ABOUT, CARS, BLOG, CONTACT US, and LOGIN. While creating this website, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I deployed this website using Static Web apps, created a bot using Azure Bot Services, and Deployed the same on Telegram.

While we have other platforms such as Uber and Ola. However, Rent4U rents a car to its users, which they can drive themselves.
